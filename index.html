        <h2>How to Write an Effective Error Message</h2>
        <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p>

        <p>Yer a wizard Harry There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends, She needs to sort out her priorities It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be The wand chooses the wizard I am what I am an Im not ashamed.</p>

        <p>Gryffindor It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities How very irritating Words are in my not so humble opinion our most inexhaustible source of magic capable of both influencing injury and remedying it, But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be Its wingardium leviOsa not leviosAH There are all kinds of courage Of course it is happening inside your head Harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real Really Hagrid if you are holding out for universal popularity Im afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more.</p>

        <p>10 points to Gryffindor Not my daughter you bitch Always Until the very end Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean we all have Always, But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light 10 points to Gryffindor Theres no need to call me Sir Professor Harry Potter Hermione Granger Its wingardium leviOsa not leviosAH Never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain. Hermione Granger The wand chooses the wizard Really Hagrid if you are holding out for universal popularity Im afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time</p>

        <h2>Introducing Lambda Next — Our Revolutionary New Job Search and Placement Program</h2>
        <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p>

        <p>Lambda School’s first graduates are now on the job market and we’ve been astonished by their success. Despite coming from very diverse circumstances and having every level of experience and educational background imaginable, every single Lambda School graduate who has been on the job market for six months is either employed in a full-time role as a software engineer or has joined an early startup working for equity.</p>

        <p>We’re proud of that early success. But as we look at the student journey, we realize there’s an opportunity for our career services team to reach a level no one has ever seen before.</p>

        <h3>What is Lambda Next?</h3>
        <p>Entering the job market can be intimidating and confusing, especially if you’re looking for your first job in a new field.</p>

        <p>To that end, we’re taking the same full-time structure, support, guidance, and direction we give during the classroom portion of Lambda School and applying it to the job search. Most students consider Lambda School to be one of the most challenging and productive times of their lives, and now that will carry through into looking for a career.</p>

        <p>Lambda Next has its own team of Career Services experts and assistants on staff, and follows the same full-time schedule as Lambda School proper (8 am to 5 pm Pacific).</p>

        <h2>Announcing Lambda School Labs — Our In-House Software Apprenticeship</h2>
        <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p>

        <p>Every software engineer trying to break into the industry has experienced the same problem — seemingly everybody wants to hire engineers with experience. For many junior engineers it becomes the ultimate “chicken and egg” problem. How do you get experience without getting a job? And without a job, how do you get experience?</p>

        <p>We’ve hired senior devs and project managers who will be taking on and organizing projects, and students will show up on day one to problems that need to be solved, bugs that need to be squashed, and tickets that need to be closed. We’ll be building real, production-ready software on real teams.</p>

        <p>Of course, money isn’t the end goal of any of this — making money is simply a barometer to use to determine whether a project meets our stringent criteria — but we fully expect that many projects will actually succeed. If this happens, students will simply split 100% of the revenue evenly amongst themselves. Lambda School doesn’t ever take a cut, it’s just one more thing we do to make our engineer-graduates the best they can possibly be.</p>

        <p>Thats the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily Of course it is happening inside your head Harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real She needs to sort out her priorities Of course it is happening inside your head Harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real The things we lose always have a way of coming back to us in the end There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them I am what I am an Im not ashamed Never be ashamed my ol dad used ter say theres some wholl hold it against you but theyre not worth botherin with. The things we lose always have a way of coming back to us in the end Now Im going to bed before either of you comes up with another clever idea to get us killed Or worse expelled Hermione Granger I am what I am an Im not ashamed Never be ashamed my ol dad used ter say theres some wholl hold it against you but theyre not worth botherin with Words are in my not so humble opinion our most inexhaustible source of magic capable of both influencing injury and remedying it Give her hell from us Peeves 10 points to Gryffindor Of course it is happening inside your head Harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real Harry Potter.</p>
